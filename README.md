# Ark

Ark is an OMP plugin plus a deterministic `ark` CLI that takes a ticket across one or several dependent repos to merge-ready MRs with a complete, replayable record. Agents do the judgment and write the code; the CLI does everything mechanical. See [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md).

## Dev setup

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4 and [OMP](https://omp.sh).

```sh
bun install         # dependencies
bun link            # puts `ark` on PATH (plugin install does not)
omp plugin link .   # installs this repo as an OMP plugin
bun test            # runs the tests
```

Undo with `bun unlink` and `omp plugin uninstall ark`.

## Run core

`ark` finds its project from the nearest `ark.yml` (`project:` key) above the current directory and keeps state under `$ARK_HOME` (default `~/.ark`): tickets in `projects/<project>/tickets/<ID>.md`, runs in `projects/<project>/runs/<date>-<ID>/`.

```sh
ark run start ARK-109                  # start the run, or show the existing one
ark advance <run_id> <event> [--data json]   # legal transitions only (cli/transitions.ts)
ark run replay <run_id> [--check]      # rebuild state.json from ledger.ndjson
```
