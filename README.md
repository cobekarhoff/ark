# Ark

Ark is an OMP plugin plus a deterministic `ark` CLI that takes a ticket across one or several dependent repos to merge-ready MRs with a complete, replayable record. Agents do the judgment and write the code; the CLI does everything mechanical. See [docs/prd.md](docs/prd.md).

## Dev setup

Requires [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.4 and [OMP](https://omp.sh).

```sh
bun install         # dependencies
bun link            # puts `ark` on PATH (plugin install does not)
omp plugin link .   # installs this repo as an OMP plugin
bun test            # runs the tests
```

Undo with `bun unlink` and `omp plugin uninstall ark`.
